# Learning Journal- Day 5

Today I learned about form manipulation using jQuery, marked.js, and hightlight.js. It was pretty cool to be able to use forms to create a new object that could be displayed in the same format as the other articles on the page using the code we had written the past few days. I also started experimenting with viewport widths as height values in my portfolio. It works really well for the mobile sized screens but as soon as you switch to larger screens you basically have to remake the entire page. I am still not sure if it looks efficient yet but I'll find out.
