#Learning Journal- Day 2

Today I have gotten much more comfortable with the terminal and github. It is pretty fun learning how to navigate and manipulate files without a mouse. I also feel like I have gotten a better grip on how inline and block elements react and how to manipulate them. I have a long way to go before I have adequate control of the format but I know it'll come. I need to practice my html organization a bit more but I'm sure there will be no shortage of that in the days to come.
